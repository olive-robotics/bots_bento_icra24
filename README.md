## Challenge Description
Within the Bots & Bento Challenge, competitors are tasked with designing and programming a robot that is able to locate, transport and sort standardized palettes containing the Japanese delicacy Bento. The rules are simple: given a pre-defined set of available hardware components, design your own robot and let it carry and sort palettes as high and as efficiently as possible.

## Intorduction
Our goal is to drive innovation in autonomous material handling through a competition in which teams design and build robots using identical, pre-supplied robotics kits to perform pallet handling tasks within a specified area as part of our first challenge. 

This first inaugural competition, co-organized by Olive Robotics, UTokyoIPC and TUM Venture Lab Robotics / AI, is a competitive platform for IEEE ICRA 2024, and is designed to foster innovation and practical skills among budding robotics professionals in the field of autonomous material handling. Within the Bots & Bento Challenge, competitors are tasked with designing and programming a robot that is able to locate, transport and stack standardized palettes containing the Japanese delicacy Bento. The rules are simple: given a pre-defined set of available hardware components, design your own robot and let it stack palettes as high and as efficiently as possible.

The Bots & Bento Challenge at IEEE ICRA 2024 will be held from May 13th to May 17th in Yokohama, Japan. Acting as the local partner in Japan, UTokyoIPC will be responsible for handling most of the on-site organizational tasks, whereas the Germany-based team takes care of supporting participants and shipping hardware and providing the simulation environment and later on be onsite to manage the competition itself. To ensure first-class support to all challenge participants, the number of teams allowed to participate is limited to six teams with up to six team members each.

Challenge preparation and training in virtual environments
In order to streamline processes and reduce the burden to participants of shipping large, bulky robotic setups to Japan with potential complications in customs, freight and clearance and thus delayed hardware deliveries, the challenge preparation phase is streamlined to be quite lean. The participants will receive a reduced-size ‚Äúsample kit‚Äù approx. two months in advance with the most important components to get their hands on the actual hardware. The entirety of competition hardware needed is sent to Japan by the challenge organizers instead. This guarantees smooth transport of hardware and improves logistics handling.
Additionally, we introduce a virtual simulation environment with a detailed representation of the challenge arena and the robot hardware (eg. given in Gazebo, URDF) already sent approx. three months in advance. In this virtual representation participants are able to design and train their robots to handle and stack the Bento boxes. At ICRA, participants will then get two days of time upfront to assemble their own robots based on their virtual designs.

## Awards & Budget
TUM Venture Lab Robotics / AI and UTokyo IPC will both share the burden of supplying max 12 teams with robotics kits, which will be returned by the teams to the hosts after the competition. 

üèÜ All teams that meet the qualifications and participate will be awarded certificates of participation. The announcement of the final award prize for the top-performing teams will be made shortly.

## Safety Considerations
The safety considerations for this challenge are relatively straightforward: as the arena is walled with robust barriers on each side and the machines will move at relatively low speed (~1m/s at max), it is very unlikely for a robot to escape the arena. Within the arena safety hazards might be represented by the robot or stacks of pallets falling over. Thus to avoid harm to visitors and the contestants, no one is allowed to enter the arena while a competition run is under way.

## Competition History
TUM Venture Lab Robotics / AI and UTokyo IPC want to set up a permanent competition that will hopefully become part of ICRA. The goal is to strengthen future ICRAs in the EU by offering a similar second competition, and then to host a Japanese challenge. The idea came up during the exchange of ideas between the TUM Venture Lab Robotics / AI and UTokyo IPC in June and October 2023.

## Alignment with ICRA
The "Bots & Bento" challenge embodies cutting-edge robotics and AI technologies pivotal in modern autonomous systems. SLAM algorithms are honed for accurate robot localization amidst dynamic environments, while efficient path planning is crucial for optimizing the collection and stacking of pallets. Precise motion control ensures safe and accurate handling of pallets for stable stacking. The competition leverages ROS and ROS2 frameworks for orchestrating a seamless choreography between perception, decision-making, and control, fostering modular, collaborative robotics development. Additionally, sensor fusion and machine learning for perception are crucial for a holistic understanding of the environment and advanced object recognition, respectively.

The competition further promotes real-time systems ensuring robustness in dynamic, unstructured environments, a core theme in contemporary robotics research. The provision of a hardware kit encourages hardware-software co-design, fostering innovation in integrated solutions for autonomous material handling. AI-driven decision-making enables adaptive strategies for stacking pallets based on their IDs, optimizing the process further. Although not explicitly mentioned, potential Human-Robot Interaction elements could be integrated to ensure safety and collaboration in shared spaces. Through a practical, industrially-relevant challenge, this competition provides a platform for the ICRA community to showcase, test, and advance the state-of-the-art in robotics and AI, aligning perfectly with ICRA's mission of propelling the global robotics community forward.
